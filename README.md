# WindowsSoftwareSetter
Run this batch script to install all the basic Application Software needed after a new windows Installation  
In this example, the batch file sets the file paths for the software installation files and runs each setup file with the /silent switch to prevent user interaction during the installation process. After all software installations are complete, the batch file displays a message and waits for the user to press a key before closing. You can add more software installations as needed by adding additional set and echo statements for each software package.
